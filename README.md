# UNA
This repository contains the code for generating **U**niversal-**N**oise **A**nnotation (UNA), which is a more practical setting that encompasses all types of noise that can occur in object detection. Additionally, experiment configuration files, log files, and links to download pre-trained weights are included.

You can use this code to simulate various types of noise and evaluate the performance of object detection models under different noise settings. It provides a comprehensive framework for studying the impact of noise on object detection algorithms.
